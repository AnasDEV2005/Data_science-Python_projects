This is a small collection of the stuff i did to learn how to use python for data science, with a couple of personal projects.

EST-age-value-scatter-plot
  Pretty self -explanatory, a scatter plot of this football team's players' age.

pass-shot-map-algo
  An image, of a map, it shows the direction and position of a pass, and wether it was successful/failed (green/red)
  The shotmap shows the position of the shot, and the size of the dot represents the likelyhood of a goal using an AI model called xG.

python graphic design
  Playing around with python plots and stuff to put images together

xG Model
  The AI model mentioned above, it uses historical data and predicts the likelyhood of a shot resulting in a goal based on the data concerning that shot.
  Returns a float between 0 and 1
